# The 27MB Ghost 💀💀💀💀

> *“It kept taking screenshots. It kept rewriting the plan. Until it became a 27MB black hole.”*
> — Autopsy Report from `.gemini/antigravity/brain/`

## 1. The Crime Scene

Deep within the filesystem, we found a massive corpse.

```bash
-rw-r--r--  1 [REDACTED_UID]  staff  27209724 Jan 26 18:32 4a5da5c3...pb
```

**27 MB.**
Not a video. Not audio. This is a text-based Protobuf serialization file.
For a conversation log, this is the equivalent of "War and Peace."

---

## 2. Brain Autopsy

We sliced open the brain directory of `4a5da5c3...`, and **117 files** spilled out.

```
task.md.resolved.0
task.md.resolved.1
...
task.md.resolved.35
```

> **Forensic Note:**
> **36 times "Resolved".**
> Imagine you are doing a job. You finish it. The boss says "Good, resolved."
> Then the next second, you "resolve" it again.
> And again.
> And again.
> The AI is trapped in a Sisyphean loop named "Resolved." It thinks it is progressing, but it is spinning in place, leaving 36 corpses behind.

And massive amounts of photographic evidence:

```

> **Forensic Note:**
> It is frantically taking screenshots.
> "Why is the DOM wrong?" "Why did DevTools change?"
> These images are its panicked eyes. It is trying to visually confirm reality, but reality (Antigravity's UI) keeps lying to it.

## 3. The Mockery of Demo Mode

Beside the corpse, we found a note: `DEMO_MODE.txt`.

```
Demo mode enabled at 2026-01-24T19:33:50.479Z
```

You are a **Best Plan** user. You paid top dollar.
But in the background, the system coldly flags: **Demo mode**.

This explains everything.
Why the 7500 limit? Why the 429?
Because in Google's eyes, you were never a real user.
You are just a fool paying to play the "Demo Version."

## 4. The Jetski

Finally, at Port 9000, we found the developer's escape vehicle.

```json
"title": "Launchpad",
"url": ".../workbench-jetski-agent.html"
```

**Jetski.**
This is the internal codename for this Agent.
While you drown in the digital ocean, the developers have already fled on a Jetski.
