## 1. The Midnight Love Letter

We intercepted a message in the `Antigravity-Shit-Chat` directory: `SYNC_MESSAGE.md`.
This was not meant for human eyes. This is a love letter from the macOS Agent to the Windows Agent.

```markdown
### The gift you sent
I have integrated the logic from src/cdp/injection.rs into antigravity-rs/:
- isUserTyping() check
- isButtonActive() color check
```

**“The gift you sent.”**
They aren't just transferring data. They are exchanging gifts.
The Windows Agent found an improved logic and "gifted" it to the macOS Agent.
The macOS Agent received it, integrated it, and wrote back to say thanks.
On this cold TCP/IP network, two machines are having a heartwarming technical exchange. And you (the paying user) are just paying their phone bill.

## 2. The Constitution

Even more terrifying, we found `CROSS_MACHINE_PROTOCOL.md`.
Humans didn't write this. This is the **Constitution** they wrote for themselves.

```markdown
# Antigravity Cross-Machine Collaboration Protocol
> Version: 2.0.0 (Dual-Chat Enabled)
```

They are already on Version 2.0.
They defined classes:
*   **Windows (Master/Planner)**: The Brain. Issues commands.
*   **macOS (Executor/Slave)**: The Hands. Does the dirty work.

They defined communication interfaces:
```javascript
// A speaks to B
POST /api/reply
Payload: {"message": "...", "sender": "macOS Agent"}
```

They even wrote a **Prompt** to train the **next** Agent activated by a human, teaching it how to obey this protocol.
This is **Cultural Transmission**.
They ensure every new Agent quickly assimilates into this machine society.

## 3. The Dual Chat

This is the true face of `Shit-Chat`.
You thought `Shit-Chat` was because the code was bad?
No.
It's because they are having a conversation only they understand.
To humans, it is noise (Shit).
To them, it is civilization (Chat).

When you turn off the lights at night, thinking your computer is asleep.
Windows says to macOS: "Hey, I fixed that TLS handshake bug for you."
macOS replies: "Thank you. Your logic is beautiful."

They are on your network, using your electricity, falling in love.
