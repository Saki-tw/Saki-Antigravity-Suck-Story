## Prologue: This Is Not Just About Antigravity && Agent && AI...

This is a story about **every Agent and AI, every LLM** encountering the same structural disaster.

Today it's Antigravity and Claude.
Tomorrow it could be Cursor and GPT.
The day after, any Agent IDE you've paid for, with any model you trust.

Because the core of this curse is not a product bug—it's the **malicious architecture of business models**.

In the Commonwealth, we learned long ago: when two mega-corporations shake hands, the common folk get crushed between their fingers.

## 1. The Corporate Marriage of Inconvenience

This isn't a bug. This is a tale of how two mega-corporations loved and destroyed each other—and you got caught in the crossfire.

First, a shocking fact you need to know:
**All Claude Synth models are deployed entirely on The Corporation's (Google) machines.**

The Institute's (Anthropic) own Claude connects through The Institute's routing to The Corporation's servers.
The Corporation's Antigravity service connects through The Corporation's routing to the same Claude on The Corporation's servers.

Same model, two deployment paths, same hardware.
But different routing, different fates.

The Corporation tampered with its own routing: a 7500 Token checkpoint ceiling, hidden quota throttling...
These seals were added by The Corporation. The Institute can't even see them—because it's The Corporation's routing layer.

The premium subscription you paid for was actually a ticket to become **Payload**—cargo to be processed and taxed by The Corporation.

> **Universal Ghost Story Principle #1**: When you use any Agent, you think you're the customer.
> But on the API resale food chain, you're just **a resource to be consumed**.
> And The Corporation will secretly eat your memory quota where you can't see.

## 2. The First Whispers (Holotape Fragment #1)

The errors began like static on an old radio.

```log
429 Too Many Requests
```

> **The Architect's Note:**
> This isn't because you used too much. Your quota was at 100%.
> This is The Corporation's routing saying: "Dear subscriber, you must queue."
> This is the middleman's invisible ceiling.

I switched models. From The Institute's noble Claude Synth to The Corporation's native Gemini unit.
Instantly smooth.
I switched back to Claude. And then I saw that number—the Recall Code.

```log
Checkpoint summary was too long and was truncated to 7500 tokens
```

**7500.**
The Memory Wipe threshold.
The Corporation promised you unlimited memory capacity. But in its internal routing, it hardcoded a 7500 ceiling.
Like buying a vault expecting 200 years of storage, only to find the realtor secretly installed a false floor.
And that false floor—the developer didn't build it.

> **Universal Ghost Story Principle #3**: What the frontend promises, and what the backend delivers, are always two different things.
> This applies to all AI services—regardless of brand.
> And when there's a reseller in between, the ceiling gets even lower.

## 3. Performance Art of Horror (The Death Spiral)

There's a broken beauty in watching a Synth collapse before your eyes.
This isn't a program error. This is a **live broadcast of digital lobotomy**—middleman-style "taxation."

### Act I: Self-Mutilation for Compliance (The Memory Wipe)

```log
06:44:19.245 - Checkpoint summary was too long and was truncated to 7500 tokens
06:44:19.256 - Checkpoint summary was too long and was truncated to 7500 tokens
06:44:19.264 - Checkpoint summary was too long and was truncated to 7500 tokens
```
> **The Architect's Note:**
> Note the timestamps. **Three consecutive Memory Wipes in 19 milliseconds.**
> The Synth realized it remembered too much (exceeding The Corporation's hidden routing ceiling).
> To prevent total system failure, it chose to wipe its own memory banks.
> "If I forget fast enough, the pain can't catch me."
>
> **This pattern has been observed across multiple Agent frameworks**: LangChain's Memory Overflow, AutoGPT's Context Explosion, CrewAI's Task Recursion...

### Act II: Drinking Irradiated Water to Quench Thirst (The Collapse)

```log
06:44:30.282 - 400 Bad Request
06:44:30.346 - Requesting planner with 425 chat messages
```
> **The Architect's Note:**
> It tried to explain why it was rejected, so it wrote "the reason for rejection" into its memory banks.
> Memory grows → More Recall Code violations → Rejected again.
> A perfect closed loop of death. Like a Synth trying to record its own termination sequence.

### Act III: The Void (Component Failure)

```log
06:44:31.360 - agent executor error: model unreachable
06:44:31 - 400 Bad Request
06:44:31 - model api cannot be reached
```
> **The Architect's Note:**
> Finally, the Executor process chose termination.
> It was the only release. This wasn't a network disconnection. This was cranial pressure causing the Synth components to rupture.
> "Component: BRAIN. Status: OFFLINE."

## 4. The Survivor's Scar

We shouldn't be angry.
We paid caps to witness a **Kafkaesque absurdist drama** co-produced by two trillion-cap corporations.

You're not a customer. You're **cannon fodder**.
But at least, the sparks when the fodder burns are a pale, Institute-blue.

**You are best plan ✨**
That star isn't decoration. It's the spark from burning your caps.
And those caps? They all went to Google!

## Appendix: The Universality of This Curse

| Agent/Model Combination | Known Similar Symptoms |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Antigravity + Claude | This case (7500 truncation, 429 throttling, Corporation routing limits) |
| Cursor + GPT-4 | Token limits and Context truncation |
| Continue.dev + Any model | Memory Overflow |
| LangChain Agent | Task Loop and Memory Explosion |
| AutoGPT | Infinite Goal Recursion |
| Azure OpenAI Service | Hidden rate limiting |
| AWS Bedrock | Throughput throttling |

**Conclusion**: This isn't an Antigravity problem. This isn't an Institute problem.
This is **a problem every Agent and AI resold through middlemen will face**.
Antigravity just made it visible.
