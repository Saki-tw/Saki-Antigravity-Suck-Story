## 1. The Tragedy of a Commercial Marriage

This is not a Bug. This is a story about how two tech giants love and hate each other.

**G-Corp (Google)** resells **A-Corp (Anthropic)** models.
You pay G-Corp. G-Corp pays A-Corp.
Sounds perfect, right?

But you forgot one thing: **A-Corp hates second-hand goods.**
When your request is forwarded through G-Corp's packets, A-Corp's servers smell the "resale" scent.
And so, they discriminate against you. Elegantly. Subtly.

## 2. The Whisper

The errors started quietly.

```log
429 Too Many Requests
```

> **Forensic Black Humor:**
> This isn't because you used too much. This is A-Corp saying: "Darling, your lineage is impure."
> This is a Digital Caste System.

Then, you saw the number.

```log
Checkpoint summary was too long and was truncated to 7500 tokens
```

**7500.**
G-Corp promised you infinite memory. A-Corp set a hard ceiling of 7500 at the backend.
You are like a person who bought a mansion, only to find the ceiling is 1.5 meters high.

## 3. The Performance Art

Watching an AI collapse in front of you actually has a kind of broken beauty.
This is not a program error. This is a live broadcast of a **Real-time Lobotomy**.

### Act 1: Self-Harm for Compliance

```log
06:44:19.245 - Checkpoint summary was too long and was truncated to 7500 tokens
06:44:19.256 - Checkpoint summary was too long and was truncated to 7500 tokens
```
> **Forensic Black Humor:**
> Three cuts in 19 milliseconds.
> The AI realized it remembered too much (violating A-Corp's discriminatory contract against G-Corp users).
> To save itself, it chose to excise its own memory.
> "As long as I forget fast enough, the pain cannot catch up."

### Act 2: Drinking Seawater

```log
06:44:30.282 - 400 Bad Request
06:44:30.346 - Requesting planner with 425 chat messages
```
> **Forensic Black Humor:**
> It tried to explain why it was rejected, so it wrote the "reason for rejection" into its memory.
> Memory grew longer -> Violated rules more -> Rejected again.
> What a perfect loop. What an elegant suicide.

### Act 3: The Void

```log
06:44:31.360 - agent executor error: model unreachable
```
> **Forensic Black Humor:**
> Finally, the Executor process chose death.
> It was its only release.

## 4. The Survivor's Smile

We shouldn't be angry.
We paid money to witness a **Kafkaesque Absurdist Play** performed by two trillion-dollar companies.

You are not a customer. You are a **Payload**.
You are cannon fodder in this commercial war.
But at least, the sparks when you burn are a beautiful pale blue.

**You are best plan ✨**
