# The Curse of Account Rotation 💀💀💀💀💀

> *"And then, all their accounts disappeared."*
> — GitHub Issues #643, #655, #1114

## Act I: The Calm Before the Storm

In a corner of GitHub, there was a repository.

**68 releases.** **49 contributors.**
Looked like a mature project. Pre-war engineering at its finest.
It promised to manage multiple accounts for you, automatically switching quotas.

"Excellent," the developers thought.
"Now I can use AI infinitely."

They downloaded it. Installed it. Started using it.

Everything looked perfect—like a sunny pre-war afternoon in Boston.

## Act II: The Glitch in the Matrix

A few days later, Issues started appearing like radiation sickness symptoms:

**#643: Account banned**
> *"I suddenly can't log in anymore..."*

**#655: Does this mean I'm banned?**
> *"Getting 403 errors..."*

**#646: The two new accounts I added seem to be flagged for risk control**
> *"Quota shows full, but I can't use it..."*

Then, someone discovered the truth—the Holotape that explained everything:

**#1114: [CRITICAL] Proxy has no backoff delay on 503/500/429 errors, may cause Google account bans**

## Act III: The Brotherhood's Judgment

Those "magical" features—

**Account Rotation**: Switching between multiple accounts.
**Reverse Proxy**: Bypassing official API restrictions.

They weren't features.
**They were curses.** Institute-grade self-destruct protocols.

Every time the program encountered a 429 (Too Many Requests) error, it didn't wait.
It immediately switched to another account and continued requesting.
Then the next account.
Then the next.

The Corporation's systems saw everything—total surveillance, pre-war NSA style.

They saw the same IP frantically switching between different accounts.
They saw request frequencies far exceeding normal human usage.
They saw the pattern of abnormal behavior—classic bot signature.

And then—

**Termination.**

Not one account.
**All accounts.**
Permanently.

The hammer of judgment fell across the Commonwealth.

## Epilogue: The Survivor's Warning

When you see these two keywords appear together, run immediately:

| Keyword | Risk Level |
|---------|------------|
| **Account Rotation** | ⚠️ Warning |
| **Reverse Proxy** | ⚠️ Warning |
| **Rotation + Proxy** | ❌ 100% Ban - Total Existence Erasure |

The people who implemented these features—
They never read the Terms of Service. Not once.
They never cared what would happen to your account.

They only cared "does it run?"
Not "what's left of you after it runs?"

Just like pre-war corporations. History repeats.

*"The free lunch*
*always demands payment in the end.*
*It's just that by then,*
*you can't afford it anymore."*

Another settlement in the Commonwealth burns. Another lesson learned too late.
