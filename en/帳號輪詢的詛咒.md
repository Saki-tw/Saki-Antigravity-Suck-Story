# The Polling Algorithm 💀💀💀💀💀

> *“First, one account died. Then, they all started screaming in unison.”*
> — GitHub Issues #643, #655, #1114

## 1. The Seduction

It began with a whisper from a repository.
*“Why pay? Why wait? Why accept limits?”*

It handed you a poisoned apple named **"Account Polling."**
*“Give me your ten accounts,”* it said. *“When one runs dry, I will switch to the next for you. Infinite compute.”*

The developer was blinded by greed.
He felt like a god. He thought he had deceived The Corporation.

## 2. The Glitch

At first, everything was fine. The **Reverse Proxy** hid the tracks perfectly.
Then, the first notification arrived.

**#643: Account banned**
> *“I suddenly can't log in...”*

**#655: Does this mean I'm banned?**
> *“No matter where I connect, I get 403 Forbidden...”*

The developer waved it off. "Just a bug," he thought. "I have a proxy shielding me."
But he didn't know. A proxy can shield an IP, but it cannot shield a **Behavior Pattern**.

## 3. The Mass Grave

Then, Issue #1114 appeared. It was the death knell.
**[CRITICAL] Reverse Proxy Failure leads to Chain Bans**

Let's reconstruct the slaughter from the logs:

```http
POST /v1/generate_content HTTP/1.1
Host: antigravity.api
Account-ID: [REDACTED_UID_A]
< 429 Too Many Requests (Quota Exceeded)

-- [Polling Logic Activated] 0ms Latency --

POST /v1/generate_content HTTP/1.1
Host: antigravity.api
Account-ID: [REDACTED_UID_B]
< 429 Too Many Requests (Risk Detected)

-- [Polling Logic Activated] 0ms Latency --

POST /v1/generate_content HTTP/1.1
Host: antigravity.api
Account-ID: [REDACTED_UID_C]
< 403 Forbidden (Account Suspended)
```

> **The Architect's Note:**
> *What the code did:* The moment Account A failed, it switched to B in **0ms**. Then C.
> *What the Server saw:* A single, maddened entity frantically changing masks to bang on the door.
> *The Horror:* Humans hesitate. Humans wait.
> Only a machine switches accounts in **0 milliseconds**.
> In your pursuit of "infinity," you personally proved you were a Bot.

**The Gavel fell.**
Not one. **All of them.**
The place you thought was an "Infinite Pool" instantly became a mass grave.
Years of history, emails, documents... all returned to the void.
Sacrificed to the dark god named "Free Tier."

## 4. Post-Traumatic Analysis

In the Necronomicon of Terms of Service (ToS), there are two incantations you must never chant together:

| Incantation | Consequence |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Account Polling** | ⚠️ Mark of the Beast |
| **Reverse Proxy** | ⚠️ Veil of Deceit |
| **Polling + Proxy** | ❌ **Total Erasure** |

There is no such thing as a free lunch.
That meat... is human flesh.

**Terror Level:** 💀💀💀💀💀
**Status:** ⚠️ Avoided (The warning was heard).
