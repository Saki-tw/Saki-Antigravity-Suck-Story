## 🎯 The Collections

We collect **true experiences**, enhanced by the atmospheric dread of the uncanny valley. We are looking for stories where the machine behaved in ways that felt... *personal*.

| Type | Description | Keywords |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **The Undead** 💀 | Processes, services, or bugs that survive `kill -9`. The persistent hauntings of the operating system. | `defunct`, `zombie`, `orphan process`, `immortal` |
| **The Phantom** 👻 | Data that appears in the UI but vanishes when you query the database. The gaslighting of the frontend. | Null pointers, quota hallucinations, phantom traffic, hydration errors |
| **The Leech** 🧛 | Systems that silently drain resources—money, tokens, memory—while you sleep. | Memory leaks, API overages, recursive billing, forgotten cloud instances |
| **The Siren** 😈 | Elegant solutions that lure you onto the rocks of destruction. The "Clean Code" that effectively bricked production. | Over-engineering, optimization traps, "Best Practice" backlash |
| **The Labyrinth** 🌀 | Logic flows that trap the execution pointer in infinite loops. The event horizon of the call stack. | Infinite recursion, deadlocks, callback hell, circular dependencies |
| **The Curse** 🔮 | Bugs that disappear when you attach a debugger. The Heisenbugs. The ones that only happen on Tuesdays. | Race conditions, quantum bugs, production-only horrors |

## 📝 Story Format

We encourage a narrative style that blends **technical rigor** with **Lovecraftian existential dread**.

```markdown
# [Story Title]

> *“A single line of text that foreshadows the doom to come.”*

## The Setting (The calm before the storm)
Describe the environment. The quiet hum of the server room. The false sense of security provided by a passing CI build.

## The Anomaly (The glitch in the matrix)
What was the first sign? A flickering log? A latency spike? A number that didn't add up?

## The Descent (The investigation)
Detail the debugging process. The realization that standard tools are useless. The feeling of being watched by the code.

## The Horror (The revelation)
What was the root cause? Was it a race condition? Or was it... something else?
*Include stack traces, code snippets, and logs as evidence of the haunting.*

## The Survivor's Scar (The aftermath)
What did you learn? What rituals (tests) do you perform now to keep the darkness at bay?

## ⚠️ The Laws of the Graveyard

### The Principle of Permanence
> **Once your story is merged, it is etched in stone.**

- We **promise** not to delete any merged story.
- History is immutable. To delete a bug report is to invite it to happen again.
- You may submit a "Sequel" or "Addendum," but the original horror stands.

### What Will Be Exorcised (Rejected)
- Malicious intent or hate speech.
- Private keys or PII (We want ghost stories, not lawsuits).
- Fiction that lacks a technical soul.
