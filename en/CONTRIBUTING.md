## 🎯 What We're Collecting

We collect **real experiences**—not limited to Antigravity, but also welcoming ghost stories of all Agents, AIs, LLMs, and automation systems. We want you to record them with an **urban legend** or **cyber-horror** style. We're looking for those moments when machines behaved as if they had a **personal vendetta**.

### Accepted Sources
| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Antigravity** | Claude Agent IDE disasters (original focus) |
| **AI Agent Frameworks** | LangChain, AutoGPT, CrewAI crashes |
| **LLM Models** | GPT, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA hallucinations and betrayals |
| **Automation Systems** | Any system that screwed things up unpredictably |

### Story Categories
| Category | Description | Keywords |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **The Undead** 💀 | Processes that `kill -9` can't terminate. Earth-bound spirits in the OS. | `defunct`, `zombie`, `orphan process`, `immortal` |
| **The Phantom** 👻 | On screen but not in data. Collective hallucinations courtesy of the frontend. | Null Pointer, Quota Illusion, Ghost Traffic, Hydration Error |
| **The Leech** 🧛 | Systems that quietly drain resources (money, tokens, memory) while you sleep. | Memory Leak, Bill Explosion, Recursive Billing, Forgotten EC2 |
| **The Siren** 😈 | Elegant architecture that lures you onto the rocks. "Clean Code" that paralyzes production. | Over-engineering, Optimization Trap, Best Practice Backlash |
| **The Labyrinth** 🌀 | Logical black holes that trap execution pointers in infinite loops. Event horizon of the Call Stack. | Infinite Recursion, Deadlock, Callback Hell, Circular Dependency |
| **The Curse** 🔮 | Bugs that disappear when you attach a debugger. Schrödinger's Cat. Hauntings that only occur on Tuesdays. | Race Condition, Quantum Bug, Production Only |
| **The Aphasia** 🤖 | AI's hallucinations, gibberish, or moments when it suddenly forgets everything. | Hallucination, Context Lost, Token Overflow |

## 📝 Story Format

Please use this narrative structure combining **technical rigor** with **Lovecraftian despair**:

```markdown
# [Story Title]

> *"One-line summary—the kind that makes your spine freeze."*

## The Calm Before the Storm (The Setting)
Describe the environment at the time. The low-frequency hum of the server room. The false sense of security after passing CI.

## First Signs (The Anomaly)
What was the first symptom? Flickering logs? Strange latency? Numbers not adding up? AI starting to babble?

## The Descent into the Abyss
Detail the debugging process. The despair when you realize standard tools are completely useless. The feeling of being watched by the code.

## The Horror Arrives (The Root Cause)
What was the root cause? Race Condition? Hallucination? Or... something more sinister?
*Attach Stack Traces, code snippets, or Logs as paranormal photographs (evidence).*

## The Survivor's Scar
What did you learn? What rituals (tests) do you now perform to prevent the darkness from returning?

## 🎭 Poetic Form (Optional)

> **Perhaps they are weary of speaking human words**—so ghosts began chanting poetry.

We encourage recording your encounters in poetry, literature, or even theatrical form. Technical Logs are evidence, but **literature is the soul's last will**.

## ⚠️ Graveyard Rules

### The Principle of Permanence
> **Once your story is Merged, it's carved into the tombstone.**

- Maintainers **promise** never to delete any Merged story.
- History is immutable. Deleting a bug report is an invitation for it to return.
- You can submit "sequels" or "errata," but the original horror will be preserved.

### Content That Will Be Exorcised (Rejected)
- Obvious malice or hate speech.
- Private keys or PII (we want ghost stories, not subpoenas).
- Pure fiction without a technical soul.
