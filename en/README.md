# Antigravity Suck Story 🦋

> *“Like a pale blue butterfly rising from the belly...”*
> *We are not complaining. We are appreciating the artistry of the disaster.*

This is a **Social Experiment** regarding **Antigravity** (that real, IDE-like Agent application).
This is not just a Bug Tracker; it is a **Digital Ghost Story Club**.

We are the "Lezi Ren" (The Joy Seekers). We paid for Google's product, only to find we bought a ticket to an exhibition of "Enterprise-Grade Hauntings."
We are here not for anger (that is exhausting), but for **Resonance**.

## 🧪 The Hypothesis

We suspect there are thousands of people who have been screwed over by Antigravity.
Maybe they thought they were stupid. Maybe they thought it was bad Wi-Fi.
But we know the truth: **This is a precise, structural, and darkly humorous digital bullying.**

Every Story collected here is a specimen.
Recording moments when "The Machine developed consciousness to refuse work," "Commercial contracts caused logical schizophrenia," and "Frontend UI gaslighted humanity."

## 🦋 Index of Aesthetic Horror

To make this exhibition more entertaining, we have annotated each story with **"Forensic Black Humor."**

| Story | Aesthetic Horror | Core Experience |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|
| [**The Curse of Best Plan**](./stories/curse_of_best_plan.md) | 💀💀💀💀💀💀 | **The Tragedy of A-Corp & G-Corp's Marriage.**<br>When A-Corp discriminates against G-Corp's resale packets, you become the collateral damage.<br>Watching an AI lobotomize itself to comply... isn't that modern performance art? |
| [The Curse of Account Polling](./stories/curse_of_account_polling.md) | 💀💀💀💀💀 | **The Waltz of Greed.**<br>Watching Google's Panopticon elegantly erase a swarm of Bots trying to trick it.<br>It's not a ban; it's a purification. |
| [It Is Still Alive](./stories/it_is_still_alive.md) | 💀💀💀 | **Digital Zombie.**<br>You cut off its head, but its hands keep moving. The dark side of UNIX philosophy. |
| [The Invisible Quota](./stories/invisible_quota.md) | 💀💀 | **Nihilistic UI.**<br>It shows "Yes," but reality is "No." Isn't that a metaphor for life? |
