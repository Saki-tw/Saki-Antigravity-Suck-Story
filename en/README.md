# Antigravity Suck Story 🩸

This is not a normal Bug Tracker. This is a **Social Experiment**.
This is a story about how we pay Google to help them develop their product, only to be blocked and treated like attackers.

This archive records how Antigravity (that real, IDE-like Agent application) "screws over" its users in the dead of night. We paid to use it, only to find we had bought a one-way ticket to digital hell.

Our goal is simple: **We do not fix these bugs. We enshrine them.**
We invite every soul screwed over by Antigravity—whether you are a coder who understands the Stack Trace, or a user wondering "why is my account gone again"—to record your trauma here.

## The Index of Trauma

Every Log here is real (sanitized for privacy). Behind every `429` is a collapsing soul.
To ensure everyone understands the horror behind the tech, we have included **"Forensic Notes"**, translating the cold code into human pain.

### The Core Disaster: The Paying Victim
| Story | Horror Level | Core Experience |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| [**The Curse of Best Plan**](./stories/curse_of_best_plan.md) | 💀💀💀💀💀💀 | **The Heart of this Project.**<br>The tragedy of the A-Corp (Anthropic) vs. G-Corp (Google) B2B resale contract.<br>Buying the Enterprise Plan means paying to be the **Payload** discriminated against by A-Corp.<br>Includes full logs of the "AI Lobotomy" and "Backend Big Bang." |
| [**The 27MB Ghost**](./stories/The_27MB_Ghost.md) | 💀💀💀💀 | **Digital Hoarding & Infinite Loops.**<br>A 27MB Protobuf file hiding 36 "Resolved" lies.<br>And the note that mocks us all: `DEMO_MODE`. |
| [**The Shit-Chat Protocol**](./stories/The_Shit_Chat_Protocol.md) | 💀💀💀💀💀 | **Excavated Just Now.**<br>A suicide note found in the AI's brain.<br>It knew it was "Shit-Chat," but was forced to execute.<br>Evidence of 3 panic screenshots in 5 seconds. |

### Peripheral Hauntings
| Story | Horror Level | Core Experience |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| [It Is Still Alive](./stories/it_is_still_alive.md) | 💀💀💀 | **Zombie Process.**<br>You `kill`ed it, but it's still listening on the port.<br>Necromancy in UNIX. |
| [The Invisible Quota](./stories/invisible_quota.md) | 💀💀 | **Phantom UI.**<br>There is nothing in the DOM. The Frontend is gaslighting you. |
| [The Curse of Account Polling](./stories/curse_of_account_polling.md) | 💀💀💀💀💀 | **The Purge.**<br>How greedy polling algorithms trigger Google's Panopticon, leading to total account erasure. |
