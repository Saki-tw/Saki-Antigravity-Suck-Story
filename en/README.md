# Antigravity Suck Story 🩸

This is not a normal Bug Tracker. This is a **Social Experiment**.
This is a story about how we pay Google to help them develop their product, only to be blocked and treated like attackers.

This archive records how Antigravity (that real, IDE-like Agent application) "screws over" its users in the dead of night. We paid to use it, only to find we had bought a one-way ticket to digital hell.

We do not fix these bugs. We **enshrine** them.
We hope to attract the masses screwed over by that bitch, Antigravity—whether you are a coder who understands the Stack Trace, or a user wondering "why is my account gone again." The pain is shared.

## The Index of Trauma

Every Log here is real (sanitized for privacy). To ensure everyone understands the horror, we have included **"Digital Coroner"** notes, translating the cold code into human pain.
