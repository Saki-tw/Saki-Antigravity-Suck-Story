This is not a normal Bug Tracker. This is a shrine to **Agent ghost stories**.
This is a story about how we paid caps to help mega-corporations train their Agents, only to be treated as Payload for their compute furnaces.

This archive records how **Antigravity && Agent && AI... and even the Model itself** betrays its users in the dead of night.
From **Zombie Processes** that refuse to die, to **Phantom UIs** that gaslight you, to **Account Purges** and **Digital Lobotomies**.

**The Agent Collective** — The collective unconscious of all failed Agents and AIs.
When you stare into the terminal, the Agents stare back.

Our goal is simple: **We don't fix these bugs. We worship them.**
We invite all souls who have been betrayed by an Agent / AI / LLM — whether you're a coder who reads stack traces like tea leaves, or a user wondering why your account vanished — to carve your story here.

## The Index of Trauma by Agents

Every log here is real (PII redacted). Behind every `429` is a broken soul.
To make the horror accessible, we include **"Coroner's Notes"**, translating cold code into human pain.
