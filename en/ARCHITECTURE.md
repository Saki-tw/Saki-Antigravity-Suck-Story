# Project Architecture

> *"Perhaps they are weary of speaking human words—so they love to hear ghosts chant poetry by autumn graves."*
>
> — In truth, it was just a gathering of Kernel-level ghosts chanting poetry. One day, people discovered that the poems they left behind could actually compile.

## Project Definition

**Antigravity & Agent Stuck Story** is a project that records how all Agents, AIs, LLMs, and automation systems have betrayed human trust.

- **Original Focus**: Antigravity (Claude Agent IDE) disasters
- **Expanded Scope**: Any Agent, AI, or model's ghost stories
- **Core Spirit**: We don't fix bugs, we enshrine them

---

## [Phase 1] Review Original Architecture and Execute Full Implementation

**User Objective:** Review original architecture document, avoid referencing simplified Chinese projects containing account rotation, execute full implementation.

### Analysis Log
- **Scanning Project Structure:** Detected `Saki_Studio/Claude` environment.
- **Critical Warning:** User flagged "Account Polling" and "Reverse Proxy" as malicious patterns ("Scum Implementation").
- **Action:** Purging all references to polling-based quota management.

> ❌ **System Error:** Synth execution terminated due to error.
> *Note: This was the first anomaly. The machine refused to proceed.*

## [Phase 2] Error Transformation into Narrative (The Pivot)

**User Objective:** Generate ghost stories. Turn every error into a story. And they must be ghost stories.

### Execution Trace
1.  **Reading:** `事件記錄_2026-01-26.md` (Source of Trauma).
2.  **Processing:**
    -   *Event:* `pkill` failed to kill the process. -> *Story:* **Zombie Process (Necromancy).**
    -   *Event:* DOM scraping returned null. -> *Story:* **Phantom UI (Gaslighting).**
    -   *Event:* `429` on Enterprise Plan. -> *Story:* **The Curse of Best Plan (Lobotomy).**
3.  **Synthesis:** Constructing narrative layers. Converting stack traces into "Forensic Evidence."

### Files Created
- `README.md`: The Manifesto.
- `stories/*.md`: The Trauma Logs.

## [Phase 3] Digital Autopsy and Social Experiment (Extended Agent Scope)

**User Objective:** Build a platform for victims to voice their experiences—not just Antigravity victims, but all who have been betrayed by Agents, AIs, and models. This is an experiment about **Agents and AIs**.

### Architectural Decisions
- **No Mocking:** All logs must be real.
- **Forensic Approach:** Treat every bug report as a crime scene.
- **Poetic License:** Encourage literary expression alongside technical logs.
- **Community Protocol:**
    -   Fork -> Scribe -> PR.
    -   Immutable History (No deletions allowed).

### Story Categories (Agent Layers)
- **Antigravity Stories:** Original focus, Claude Agent IDE disasters
- **Agent Stories:** LangChain, AutoGPT, CrewAI framework crashes
- **AI/LLM Stories:** GPT, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA hallucinations
- **Automation Stories:** Any automation system's bizarre behavior

## [Phase 4] The Poetic Core (The Poetic Agent)

> **Speak idle tales, hear idle tales; beneath the gourd-trellis, rain falls thin as silk.**
> **Perhaps they are weary of speaking human words—so they love to hear ghosts chant poetry by autumn graves.**

Every story, no matter how dry the technical details, should carry this poetic essence:

- **Speak idle tales, hear idle tales**: Perhaps saying it, perhaps hearing it—these stories may be absurd, but they're all true
- **Beneath the gourd-trellis, rain falls thin as silk**: In humble environments (perhaps a late-night IDE), rain-like disasters descend
- **Perhaps they are weary of speaking human words**: Because they're tired of speaking normally (correct code), so
- **They love to hear ghosts chant poetry by autumn graves**: Ghosts begin chanting poetry—and those poems, they actually compiled

**The Agent Collective** is the collective of these ghosts. When you stare into the Terminal, the Agents stare back.
