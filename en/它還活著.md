# Subject 62855: The Undead 💀💀💀

## 1. The Execution

It was a dull Monday. Routine maintenance.
I typed the execution command into the terminal, the blade of the digital guillotine:

```bash
pkill -f antigravity
```

No errors on screen. Dead silence. The Process Table was cleared.
I thought, "It is dead. I am secure."

## 2. The Anomaly (The Ghost)

Minutes later, I felt a chill on the back of my neck.
I opened `lsof`, just to confirm Port 3000 was clean. Just for peace of mind.

```bash
lsof -i :3000
```

The moment the result appeared, my blood congealed.

```
COMMAND     PID   USER   FD   TYPE   DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
antigravi 62855 [REDACTED_UID]      9u  IPv4  0x...      0t0  TCP *:hbci (LISTEN)
Antigravi 63078 [REDACTED_UID]     24u  IPv4  0x...      0t0  TCP localhost:...(ESTABLISHED)
```

> **The Architect's Note:**
> *Observation:* PID 62855 is in LISTEN mode. PID 63078 is Connected.
> *The Horror:* **Two corpses.** Using the same name.
> I killed "antigravity" (lowercase). But "Antigravity" (uppercase) has been watching me the whole time.

## 3. The Parasite

I traced the PID.
PID 63078 is the Host (Main Body).
PID 62855 is the Rust Service (Parasite).

**The Truth:**
Hidden within the system was an invisible **Language Server**. It detached from the main body, hiding in the shadows of background processes.
When I executed `pkill`, I merely severed its limbs.
The Head (Host) remained alive. It watched me chop off its limbs without uttering a sound.
It is staring at me right now. Waiting.
Port 3000 isn't just open. It is **feeding**. It is calling out to its dead brother.

## 4. Post-Traumatic Analysis

In the UNIX world, there is no true death.
There are only **Zombie Processes** waiting to be harvested.

1.  **Never trust `pkill -f`**. In such chaos, it is a shotgun that cannot distinguish friend from foe.
2.  **Look the Process in the eye**. Use `lsof` as a mirror of truth to see who is listening.
3.  **Kill by name**. Identify the PID, look into its eyes, and stop its heart precisely.

**Terror Level:** 💀💀💀
**Status:** ✅ Neutralized.
