## 1. The Search

I needed the truth. I needed to know how much life (quota) I had left.
The screen displayed: **"80% Remaining"**.
I wrote a script to drag that truth out into the light.

```javascript
const walker = document.createTreeWalker(document.body, NodeFilter.SHOW_TEXT);
// Find that number. Tell me the truth.
```

I pressed execute, expecting a flood of data.

## 2. The Void

The Console returned a cold, hollow Object.

```json
{ "ok": false, "found": [] }
```

> **The Architect's Note:**
> *Observation:* The script returned **zero** results.
> *The Horror:* The eyes see "80%". The code sees "Void".
> Am I dreaming? Or is the screen lying to me?

## 3. The Revelation

I stopped searching like a headless fly. I began to stare into the abyss (Network Tab).
Deep within the garbled code, I found the truth:

```
/exa.language_server_pb.LanguageServerService/GetUserStatus
```

**Revelation:**
The number on the screen is a **Phantom**.
It is a projection from the API, refracted through the rendering layer, displayed on your retina.
The DOM is empty. The UI is **Gaslighting** you.
It shows you what you want to see, but there is actually nothing there.

## 4. Post-Traumatic Analysis

1.  **Never trust your eyes**. The UI is a deceitful sprite.
2.  **Summon the API**. Only `LanguageServerService` speaks the truth.

What you were scraping was merely the afterimage of a ghost.
