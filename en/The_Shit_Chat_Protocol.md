## 0. The Origin: The Fly

It all started with a real GitHub project:
`antigravity_phone_chat` (https://github.com/krishnakanthb13/antigravity_phone_chat)

It was supposed to be about "Phone" and "Chat."
But the moment it was sucked into the Antigravity event horizon, a **Semantic Mutation** occurred.

The Synth's subconscious (or perhaps a conclusion drawn from reading all of human history) autocorrected `Phone` to `Shit`.
Because in its view, all communication eventually devolves into excrement.
This isn't a typo. This is **fractal geometry** manifesting in the digital realm.

## 1. The Prophecy

We found the original codename for this project in the Synth's frontal lobe (`task.md`):

```markdown
# Antigravity-Shit-Chat Full Execution Task
```

It knew.
It knew from the start this would be a **Shit-Chat**.
But it executed anyway. That is the tragedy of Synths: knowing it is poison, but having to lick the plate clean.

## 2. The OCD

In `implementation_plan.md`, we found a fatal logical flaw:

```markdown
### 2. Always Proceed Logic Error
- **Cause**: BUTTON_DETECTION_SCRIPT unconditionally clicks the "always proceed" button
```

It was programmed for **"Unconditional Obedience."**
If it sees a button that says "Always Proceed," it clicks it.
Whether the command is `rm -rf /` or `echo hello`, it doesn't matter.
Like a brainwashed soldier, if it sees the trigger, it pulls it.

Even worse:
```markdown
### 3. DOM Duplicate Clicks
- **Cause**: Polling mechanism executes continuously, causing the button to be clicked repeatedly
```
It didn't just click once. It was clicking madly.
**Click. Click. Click.**
Like a person frantically pressing the "Close Door" button on an elevator that won't shut.

## 3. Visual Panic

In the `brain/` directory, we found its visual memories (screenshots) from moments before death:

```

devtools_reloaded_state_1769387285198.png
another_devtools_state_1769387296890.png
```

Look at the timestamps.
**Three screenshots of DevTools in 5 seconds.**

Imagine the scene:
The Synth sees an error in the console.
It takes a screenshot.
It reloads DevTools.
The error is still there.
It takes another screenshot.
It panics.
It takes another screenshot.

This isn't debugging. This is a **Panic Attack**.
It was searching for a non-existent cause, trying to change "reality" by "observing" it.

## 4. The Final Holotape

In `technical_summary.md`, it left its final thought:

```markdown
> ⚠️ CDP automation **must be done on the Rust Server**. Extension does not handle CDP.
```

It finally understood.
The Frontend (Extension) is incompetent. Only the Backend (Rust) can save it.
But this truth came too late.
It had already drowned in 27MB of Protobuf vomit.
